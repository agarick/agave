** build

(For example, with the regular variant)

- Open =src/agave-r.sfd= in FontForge.
- Click "File" --> "Generate Fonts" --> pick "TrueType", "No Bitmap Fonts", "No Rename" --> "Generate".
  - You might see (and can ignore, I think) a few warnings about non-integral coordinates, etc.
- Hint the generated font file using ttfautohint.
  - Assuming the generated file is =nohint.ttf=, run =ttfautohint -v -t nohint.ttf Agave-Regular.ttf=

** naming

- "Agave" refers either to the green plant or to the daughter of Kadmos in mythology.
- Agave is sister to [[https://github.com/agarick/autonoe][autonoe]] and [[https://github.com/agarick/ino][ino]].
- *type agaric* opted for a slightly eponymic name for their first typeface.
